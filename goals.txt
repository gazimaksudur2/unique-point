Prompt / Project Brief
I want to build a modern e-commerce website specifically focused on ready-made fashion for boys and girls across all age groups. The platform must provide a seamless, mobile-friendly shopping experience with standard e-commerce features and WhatsApp-based checkout. The requirements are as follows:

1. User Authentication & Profile Management
Secure login and signup using email/mobile + password.
Social login options (Google) for faster onboarding.
User profile includes personal information, saved shipping addresses, and shopping history (previously added items, wishlisted items).

2. Fashion Product Catalogue & Discovery
Fashion-focused structure:
Categories based on gender (Boys / Girls), age groups (Infants, Kids, Teens, Adults), and clothing types (T-shirts, Dresses, Jeans, Ethnic Wear, Winter Wear, Footwear, Accessories, etc.).
Seasonal & festival collections (e.g., "Back to School," "Diwali Special," "Winter Fashion").
Product listing pages with:
High-quality images (multiple angles), clear price, available sizes, brand, and material details.
Filters: size, age group, price range, colors, brand, material, discount availability, new arrivals, and bestsellers.
Sorting: price low-to-high, high-to-low, newest, most popular, best deals.
Product detail pages include:
Product images with zoom-in feature.
Size chart, care instructions, customer reviews, and related styling suggestions ("Pair it with").
Stock availability & expected delivery time (optional, if implemented later).

3. Wishlist & Cart Functionality
Logged-in users can add products to wishlist.
Shopping cart to review multiple products before checkout.
Direct "Buy Now" option on each product for single-item checkout.

4. WhatsApp Checkout Integration (Core Differentiator)
On checkout, instead of online payments, redirect users to the seller’s verified WhatsApp profile with a pre-filled professional message draft.
WhatsApp message auto-fills with:
Product(s) name, selected sizes, colors, quantity, and itemized total.
If multiple products → Cart summary with totals.
Buyer details: name, phone, email (if shared in profile).
This ensures direct communication between customer and seller for final confirmation, availability check, and payment/shipping discussions.

5. Fashion-Specific Standard Features
Mobile-first design since fashion buyers shop mostly from mobile.
Guest browsing, but checkout restricted to registered users.
implement rolebased Admin/Seller dashboard to:
Manage product uploads (with sizes, colors, stock levels).
Organize collections and seasonal highlights.
Track WhatsApp orders.
Seasonal promotions & banners (discount offers, festive sales).
SEO optimization with category-based keywords (e.g., "Kids T-shirts under $20," "Teen Girls Party Wear").
Analytics integration (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) to understand user trends.
